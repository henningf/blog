### Install mongodb for backend

### NB!!! This is a work in progress with a python backend that saves to a mongodb database, you'll need to install mongodb yourself and I make no promise that the code won't brake :-)

# Backend TODO (see own README)

# Todo frontend
* [x] Add view for single post
* [x] Add route for post slug (single post)
* [ ] Add login functionality (needs to be implemented in backend first)
    * [ ] Add functionality to edit post
    * [ ] Add functionality to delete post
* [ ] Add more functionality when creating a post espesially uploading pictures
* [ ] Add parameter for api link, so that I only need to write it once
* [ ] Load functions from a single place, so that code doesn't need to be copied
